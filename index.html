    <h5>Digital Endpoints: A Catalyst for Accelerating the Rate of Drug Trial Success (Currently under review)</h5>
    <p>Personal supercomputers (i.e., smartphones and wearable sensors) gather vast amounts of data that can improve
      health and accelerate the development of novel therapies. Despite this promise, few digital endpoints –  an
      endpoint that leverages data generated by personal devices in a patient’s free living environment –  have been
      developed or accepted by regulators. In this paper, we consider the merits of digital endpoints, the regulator's
      perspective and collaborative efforts, the methods for assessing a digital endpoint's validity, and the evidence
      necessary to allay risk-averse participants.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A health and fitness management system is provided that has a health and fitness application operating, e.g., on a smart phone, that can wirelessly communicate with an activity module worn on the user which has an accelerometer. The application accepts food and weight inputs (e.g., from the smart phone) and user activity units (e.g., from the activity unit) and develops a user intrinsic metabolism. The application includes fitness arc and health quotient graphical indicators that guide the user on health and fitness activities.</p>
