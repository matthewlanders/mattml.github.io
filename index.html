    <h5>Gaps in Accelerating Digital Endpoint Development and Adoption (Currently under review)</h5>
    <p>Digital endpoints are generating considerable excitement because they permit a more authentic and objective assessment
      of the patientâ€™s experience, reveal formerly untold realities of disease burden, and can cut drug discovery costs in half.
      However, before these benefits can be realized, effort must be applied not only to the technical creation of digital endpoints,
      but also to the environment that allows for their development and application. The future of digital endpoints rests
      on meaningful interdisciplinary collaboration, sufficient evidence that digital endpoints can realize their promise,
      and the development of an ecosystem in which the vast quantities of data digital endpoints generate can be analyzed.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Wrote a perspective that defined the gaps in the development and adoption of the digital endpoints used to assess the efficacy of drug therapies</li>
      <li>Co-authored with Dr. Suchi Saria (Johns Hopkins University) and Ray Dorsey, MD (University of Rochester)</li>

    <h5>us 9,317,815 - Health and fitness management system - Issued 4/19/2016</h5>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A health and fitness management system is provided that has a health and fitness application operating, e.g., on a smart phone, that can wirelessly communicate with an activity module worn on the user which has an accelerometer. The application accepts food and weight inputs (e.g., from the smart phone) and user activity units (e.g., from the activity unit) and develops a user intrinsic metabolism. The application includes fitness arc and health quotient graphical indicators that guide the user on health and fitness activities.</p>
