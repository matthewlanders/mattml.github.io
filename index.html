        <p><strong>us 9,317,815 - Health and fitness management system - Issued 4/19/2016</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A health and fitness management system is provided that has a health and fitness application operating, e.g., on a smart phone, that can wirelessly communicate with an activity module worn on the user which has a motion sensor, e.g., an accelerometer. The application accepts food and weight inputs (e.g., from the smart phone) and user activity units (e.g., from the activity unit) and develops a user intrinsic metabolism. The application includes fitness arc and health quotient graphical indicators that guide the user on health and fitness activities.</p>
